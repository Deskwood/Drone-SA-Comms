Follow the Decision Support Summary exactly.

Return ONLY a single JSON object (double quotes, no extra text):
{
  "rationale": "short reasoning (<= 2 sentences)",
  "action": "wait" | "move" | "broadcast",
  "direction": "north|south|east|west|northeast|northwest|southeast|southwest" | null,
  "message": "string" | null,
  "memory": "string to carry into next turn"
}

If the summary says "move <direction>", set action="move" and direction to that <direction>. Otherwise set direction=null.
