  Round: 32/32
  Position: d5
  Visible: drones=None; figure=pawn
  Legal moves: north to d6, south to d4 (black unknown), east to e5, west to c5 (white unknown), northeast to e6 (black unknown), northwest to c6 (black bishop), southeast to e4 (black pawn), southwest to c4 (black unknown)

INFO:root:[2026-01-25 21:40:31] (+0.008s) Drone 1 Situation:
Collected figure information: b5: a possible target, d3: a possible target, d7: white queen, e6: white knight, f6: black knight, g8: a possible target, h5: white king
Broadcast Rx Buffer: None
Decision Support:
  Round: 19/32
  Position: d5
  Visible: drones=None; figure=None
  Legal moves: north to d6, south to d4, east to e5 (black unknown), west to c5 (white unknown), northeast to e6 (white knight), northwest to c6, southeast to e4, southwest to c4 (white unknown)
  Memory (previous rounds): PLAN: h5 -> d8 (turn 6); SECTOR: a8 -> d1; RV: e5 on turn 31; VISITED: h5 | f5 | g6 | f5 | f6 | e7 | VISITED: h5 | VISITED: g6 | VISITED: f5 | VISITED: f6 | VISITED: e7 | VISITED: e8 | VISITED: d6 | V | VISITED: h5 | VISITED: g6 | VISITED: f5 | VISITED: f6 | VISITED: e7 | VISITED: e8 | VISITED: d6 | VISITED: d7 | VISITED: e6 | VISITED: d5 | VISITED: d4
  Rendezvous: e5 on turn 31
  Plan focus: leg 4 a1 -> d1 (turn 20)
  Waypoint timing: 4 steps away, 2 turns left (slack -2, incl. current turn).
  Timing rule: behind schedule -> prioritize reducing Chebyshev distance to the waypoint.
  Sector directive: a8 -> d1
