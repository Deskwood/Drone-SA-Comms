CORASAT SOFTWARE DESIGN - v1.6
==============================
Context: `Code/corasat/*.py`. This design reflects the current module layout.

D1 Core (`classes/Core.py`)
- Owns config loading, path resolution, constants, chess helpers, and RNG seeding.
- Holds optional dependency guards (numpy/torch/pygame).

D2 Exporter (`classes/Exporter.py`)
- Timestamped logging and results.csv persistence.
- Optional notebook export when enabled and running in a notebook.

D3 Simulation (`classes/Simulation.py`)
- Orchestrates the game loop, board setup, drone creation, and scoring.
- Runs LM calls in a background thread to keep the GUI responsive.
- Applies actions sequentially and guards shared state with `state_lock`.

D4 Drone (`classes/Drone.py`)
- Orchestrates the per-turn pipeline using support components.
- Exposes convenience wrappers for mission, knowledge, and decision support.

D5 Drone Support (`classes/Drone_Support.py`)
- Knowledge: local board, edge discovery, intel sharing.
- Mission Support: sector assignment, mission planning, rx buffer consumption.
- Decision Support: scoring and prompt assembly.
- Language Model: manual input or Ollama chat.
- Aftermath: parses LM output, executes actions, updates state, returns outcome.

D6 GUI (`classes/GUI.py`)
- Pygame renderer for board, figures, paths, and sidebar info.
- Reads simulation state under the shared lock.

D7 Entry Point (`main.py`)
- Loads config via Core, iterates seeds, runs Simulation, persists results.

Data flow
- Simulation -> Drone.take_turn -> Decision Support -> Language Model -> Aftermath -> outcome -> Simulation.
